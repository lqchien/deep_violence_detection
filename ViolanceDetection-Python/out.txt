WARNING:tensorflow:From /anaconda3/envs/py36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/control_flow_ops.py:3632: colocate_with (from tensorflow.python.framework.ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Colocations handled automatically by placer.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/myaldiz/Documents/GitHub/deep_violence_detection/ViolanceDetection-Python/model.py:60: calling dropout (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with keep_prob is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
